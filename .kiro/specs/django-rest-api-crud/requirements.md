# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Django REST API demo application to support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The current implementation only supports GET requests for retrieving active users. This enhancement will add POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods to provide complete REST API functionality with proper HTTP status codes and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to create new user records via POST requests, so that I can add new users to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is sent to /demo/rest/api/ with valid name and email fields THEN the system SHALL create a new user record with a unique ID and return HTTP 201 status
2. WHEN a POST request is sent without required name field THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with error message
3. WHEN a POST request is sent without required email field THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with error message
4. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL automatically set is_active to True
5. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique UUID for the id field

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to completely replace user records via PUT requests, so that I can update all fields of an existing user.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is sent to /demo/rest/api/<id>/ with valid user data THEN the system SHALL replace all user fields except the ID and return HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN a PUT request is sent with a non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status with error message
3. WHEN a PUT request is sent without required fields THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with validation error
4. WHEN a PUT request is successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated user data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to partially update user records via PATCH requests, so that I can modify specific fields without affecting others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PATCH request is sent to /demo/rest/api/<id>/ with partial user data THEN the system SHALL update only the provided fields and return HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN a PATCH request is sent with a non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status with error message
3. WHEN a PATCH request is successful THEN the system SHALL preserve unchanged fields
4. WHEN a PATCH request is successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated user data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to delete user records via DELETE requests, so that I can remove users from the active dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is sent to /demo/rest/api/<id>/ THEN the system SHALL perform logical deletion by setting is_active to False and return HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN a DELETE request is sent with a non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status with error message
3. WHEN a DELETE request is successful THEN the system SHALL return confirmation message
4. WHEN a user is logically deleted THEN the system SHALL not return the user in GET requests (which filter by is_active=True)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to receive appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive messages, so that I can handle responses correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is successful THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 2xx status codes
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with descriptive error messages
3. WHEN a resource is not found THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status with descriptive error message
4. WHEN a resource is created THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 201 status
5. WHEN a resource is updated or deleted THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper URL routing for individual resource operations, so that the API follows RESTful conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the URL pattern is configured THEN the system SHALL support /demo/rest/api/<str:id>/ for individual resource operations
2. WHEN URL parameters are used THEN the system SHALL correctly pass the ID parameter to view methods
3. WHEN routing is configured THEN the system SHALL support PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods on the individual resource endpoint
